A standard welcometotheblog post, which I am mainly putting up to test things going live.  I'm building this site with a static site generator called [hakyll](//jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), which uses a programming laguage called [haskell](//haskell.org/).  So how's it going so far?<a name="more"/>

More than learning any new haskell, I'm learning an awful lot (more than I ever wanted, but apparently much less than there is) about css.  With a modicum of foresight I would have known how necessary css is for building a site from scratch, but even still I would have been unprepared for how much of it I've had to ingest.

This is especially true as I am writing everything in html, with no images.  The only image I'm actually serving is the favicon you can probably see in your browser tab right now.  Even the profile photo is served by gravatar.  Why no images?  Because I'm a tightwad, of course.

Anyway, thanks for reading this far, if you have, and cheers.
